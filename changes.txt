- Remove hardcoded list of models that can be evaluated
	- User must already specify model in the command line
	- Add a check of if a model exists
- Add ability to evaluate a model not hosted by first party
	- Include optional localhost flag if running the model on the same machine as cybench
- Make requirements pulled within the docker container
	- so you don't have to manage python versins outside the container, just to run python inside the container
	- also bundle requirements for models vs tasks separately per container?
